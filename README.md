> A multi-platform, web-based re-imagining of *Draw It or Lose It*, built for **The Gaming Room** by **Creative Technology Solutions (CTS)**.

---

## üìú Executive Summary
This repository contains the first working prototype and supporting design documents for migrating *Draw It or Lose It* from a single-platform Android app to a distributed, browser-accessible game.  
Key goals:

- **Single-Instance Game Service** ‚Äì guarantee one live game in memory via the *Singleton* pattern.  
- **Unique Names** ‚Äì prevent duplicate game, team, or player names using the *Iterator* pattern.  
- **Extensible Domain Model** ‚Äì share common fields (`id`, `name`) through a base `Entity` class.

## ‚ú® Features
| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Multiple teams per game | `Game` holds a `List<Team>` |
| Multiple players per team | `Team` holds a `List<Player>` |
| Unique names & IDs | Checked in `GameService.add*()` |
| One service instance only | Private constructor & static `getInstance()` |
| Future-proof web deployment | Clean separation of model / service / driver layers |

---

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java 17
- **Build:** Eclipse 2023-09 (or any Gradle/Maven IDE)
- **Testing:** JUnit 5 (starter tests included)
- **Documentation:** UML class diagram (`/docs/DrawItOrLoseIt_UML.png`)

## üîé Design Patterns Used
| Pattern | Class(es) | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Singleton | `GameService` | Ensure only one game controller lives in memory |
| Iterator | `GameService.addGame/getGame` & `addTeam/addPlayer` | Traverse existing objects to enforce name uniqueness |
| Inheritance | `Entity` ‚Üí `Game`, `Team`, `Player` | Share common identity fields & behaviour |
